Hello there. My name is Maxime, I am a researcher in robotic vision & control, currently in a postdoctoral position with MIS Laboratory, University of Picardy Jules Vernes, working on Event-based Omnidirectional Vision.

I hold a PhD in Automatics, Robotics and Production Engineering from the University of Rennes. I did my PhD studies in the Rainbow Team of Inria, Rennes, under the supervision of Fran√ßois Chaumette and Eric Marchand. My PhD work was entitled: Visual servoing of the orientation of an Earth observation satellite, and was carried out under the BPI LiCHiE project led by Airbus Defense and Space.

My research interests range from Robotic Vision, Visual Servoing, and Satellite GNC (Guidance, Navigation & Control). Especially, I am keenly interested in the design of new GNC algorithms taking advantage of vision sensors to reach a higher level of autonomous on-orbit services. I am also committed to science communication, which I contribute on various aspects
